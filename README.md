# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

I completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate in April 2022. ðŸŒŸ

The final part of the course required the completetion of a capstone project. There were sample datasets provided, along with the option to find my own dataset to analyze. I chose the latter option and used a dataset from Kaggle (found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prateekmaj21/disney-movies)) about Disney movies.

I based the project around the idea that I was working at a movie studio and was tasked with coming up with recommendations for the types of movies they should be focusing on making, with the goal of driving the highest profits. I analyzed the way that movie genres, MPAA ratings, and time affect the trends in profits for Disney movies in order to come to my conclusion.

Along with using Kaggle to find the dataset, I used Google Sheets to clean the data and R to analyze it and create visualizations!

## Final Project

I have attached images of my project documentation in order to show off some of the graphs I made in R.ðŸ“Š
